# 🚀 InsiteLoop – AI-Powered Feedback Intelligence for Product Teams

InsiteLoop is a modern SaaS tool designed to help product teams **capture**, **cluster** and **convert feedback into action** — faster and smarter.

## 🎯 Why InsiteLoop?

In my previous role, daily standups with Marketing, Development, QA, CX and Clients made one thing clear — **feedback is everywhere, but insight is nowhere if it’s scattered**.  
InsiteLoop exists to centralize that chaos and help product teams **close the feedback loop** with confidence.

## 🧠 Core Features

- ✅ **Centralize Feedback**: Collect input from different teams in one unified space  
- 🖼️ **Visual Attachments**: Add screenshots or screen recordings for better bug/UX context  
- 🤖 **AI Clustering**: Automatically group related issues, themes and feature requests  
- 📊 **Insight Visualization**: Identify trends and pain points across product areas  
- 🔄 **Prioritize with Clarity**: Drive smarter product decisions with data-backed insights  

## 🔧 Tech Focus

This repository emphasizes the **Product Engineering** aspect of InsiteLoop — showcasing backend logic, API development, feedback intelligence mechanisms and AI integrations.  

> 🛑 **Note:** Product Design (UI/UX) is intentionally minimal as the primary focus is product logic and engineering.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (minimal UI)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
